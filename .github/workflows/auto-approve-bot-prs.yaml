          This PR will require manual review and approval.
          
          For auto-approval eligibility, PRs must:
          - Be created by \`rhdh-bot\`
          - Not be in draft state
          - Have a branch name matching auto-approval patterns

          If eligible, the workflow will automatically add \`lgtm\` and \`approved\` labels and approve the PR.
