# Downstream Dockerfile

This folder contains the containerfile (dockerfile) used in Konflux downstream for RHDH builds.

It requires hermeto to cache dependencies (rpm, pip, yarn) before the build can proceed, so that the build is reproduceable/offline/hermetically sealed.

Note that some things in this repo are changed when they're synced to downstream. See link:https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/rhidp/rhdh/-/blob/rhdh-1-rhel-9/build/ci/sync-midstream.sh[build/ci/sync-midstream.sh]. Note: RH VPN required.


## How do I build this dockerfile

Depending on what you're trying to accomplish you have some options:

1. build from the link:../../docker/Dockerfile[docker/Dockerfile] instead of link:Dockerfile[.rhdh/docker/Dockerfile], using `podman build` or equivalent

2. create your own hermeto cache folder with https://github.com/hermetoproject/hermeto and then tweak this Dockerfile using ENV vars, to use your local cache folder
+
You will need to replace `YARN_GLOBAL_FOLDER=/cachi2/output/deps/yarn` to point you your local `/path/to/hermeto-output/deps/yarn` folder instead. See also link:https://github.com/hermetoproject/hermeto/blob/main/docs/usage.md#generate-environment-variables[Generating Environment Variables].

3. Use Konflux to build a merge request against the midstream repo. See link:https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/rhidp/rhdh/-/blob/rhdh-1-rhel-9/docs/RHDH-Konflux-user-guide.adoc#user-content-building-locally[Konflux user guide - building locally]. Note: RH VPN required.
