# Downstream Dockerfile

This folder contains the containerfile (dockerfile) used in Konflux downstream for RHDH builds.

It requires hermeto to cache dependencies (rpm, pip, yarn) before the build can proceed, so that the build is reproduceable/offline/hermetically sealed.

## How do I build this dockerfile

Depending on what you're trying to accomplish you have some options:

* build from the link:../../docker/Dockerfile[docker/Dockerfile] instead of link:Dockerfile[.rhdh/docker/Dockerfile], using `podman build` or equivalent

* create your own hermeto cache folder with https://github.com/hermetoproject/hermeto and then tweak this Dockerfile using ENV vars, to use your local cache folder

* Use Konflux to build a merge request against the midstream repo. See link:https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/rhidp/rhdh/-/tree/rhdh-1-rhel-9/docs[details here]. Note: RH VPN required.
