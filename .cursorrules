# Cursor Rules for RHDH Project

## Code Comments and Documentation

- ALL code comments MUST be written in English
- ALL log messages MUST be in English
- ALL documentation within code MUST be in English
- ALL commit messages MUST be in English
- This ensures international collaboration and accessibility

## Examples:

❌ BAD: # Verificar se arquivo existe
✅ GOOD: # Check if file exists

❌ BAD: echo "Processando arquivos..."
✅ GOOD: echo "Processing files..."

## Rationale:

This is a fundamental rule for international open source collaboration.
Developers from any nationality should be able to understand and contribute to the codebase.
