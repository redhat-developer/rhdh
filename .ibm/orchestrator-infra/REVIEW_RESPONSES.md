# Review Responses for PR #3616

## Response to @chadcrum

### Question: Are you including the Ansible roles on purpose?

**Short Answer**: No, they were included by mistake. I've removed all unused roles.

**Detailed Explanation**: 
I initially used the `flight-path-auto-tests` project as a base and forgot to delete the unused roles. The following roles have been removed as they are not directly related to RHDH/Orchestrator:

- `deploy-cost-metrics-operator`
- `deploy-optimizer-app`
- `deploy-orchestrator` (old version)
- `deploy-resource-optimization-plugin`
- `deploy-resource-optimization-workflow`
- `odf-node-recovery`
- `post-mortem`

Only the essential role `deploy-rhdh` remains, which handles the Orchestrator infrastructure deployment.

## Additional Fixes Applied

While addressing the review feedback, I also fixed several critical issues:

### 1. **Logic Operator Installation**
- **Problem**: CSV showing `Failed` state, no controller pod created
- **Cause**: OperatorGroup was using OwnNamespace mode, but Logic Operator requires AllNamespaces mode
- **Fix**: Configured OperatorGroup with empty spec (`spec: {}`) to enable AllNamespaces mode
- **Commit**: `07173c72`

### 2. **Namespace Configuration**
- **Problem**: Resources being deployed to wrong namespace
- **Cause**: Variable precedence issue in Ansible playbook
- **Fix**: Removed conflicting `vars_files` that was overwriting `rhdh_ns` variable
- **Commit**: `6d6994d1`

### 3. **PostgreSQL Job Wait**
- **Problem**: Script couldn't wait for init job due to missing label
- **Fix**: Added `app: init-orchestrator-db` label and updated wait command
- **Commit**: Earlier in the series

### 4. **Workflow Script Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Unnecessary git clone for workflows defined inline
- **Fix**: Removed unused repository cloning code
- **Commit**: Part of review feedback
