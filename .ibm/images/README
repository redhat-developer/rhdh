# RHDH e2e Runner - OpenShift CI Integration

## Overview
The `rhdh-e2e-runner` is a container image used in **OpenShift CI**, where it is deployed via a **mirror** that fetches the image from the Quay repository.

## Workflow for Updating the Image

### **Main Branch Workflow**
For changes to the image in `.ibm/images/Dockerfile`, follow these steps:
1. **Perform a Local Test:**
   - Before updating the `Dockerfile`, perform a local test by running the e2e tests to ensure the changes are stable.

2. **Update the Dockerfile:**
   - Once validated, update `.ibm/images/Dockerfile` with the required changes.

3. **GitHub Actions Build & Push:**
   - The **GitHub Actions workflow** automatically builds and pushes the updated image to **Quay.io**.
   - This only happens **after all tests are completed successfully**.

4. **Propagation to OpenShift CI Mirror:**
   - After the image is pushed to Quay, OpenShift CI **does not** immediately use the new image.
   - There is a delay while OpenShift updates its **mirror** with the new version.

5. **Merge to Main Branch:**
   - The image update process happens **before merging into `main`**.
   - Ensure that the updated image has been successfully used in e2e tests before merging.

### **Other Branches Workflow**
For branches **other than `main`**, OpenShift CI does **not** fetch from Quay:
- Instead, **OpenShift CI builds the image directly** from `.ibm/images/Dockerfile`.
- Any changes made to the file will **immediately reflect** in the test execution.
- There is no need to wait for an image update in the mirror.

## Key Considerations
- **Local testing is mandatory** before making any modifications.
- **GitHub Actions automates the push process** only for `main` branch updates.
- **OpenShift CI mirror has a delay** in updating the image after it is pushed to Quay.
- **Other branches build the image directly**, so changes take effect immediately.
