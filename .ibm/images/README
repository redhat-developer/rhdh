This Dockerfile creates an image to be used by the IBM Cloud pipelines

Currently this image is built by hand at intervals and pushed to https://quay.io/repository/rhdh-community/rhdh-e2e-runner?tab=tags when in need of an update.

```
SHA=$(git rev-parse --short=8 HEAD)
podman build . -f Dockerfile -t quay.io/rhdh-community/rhdh-e2e-runner:release-1.5-${SHA}
podman push quay.io/rhdh-community/rhdh-e2e-runner:release-1.5-${SHA}

In future this might be automated so that if the contents of this folder changes, a new image is pushed automatically.
