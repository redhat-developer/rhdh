## Working with Plugin Folders & Files

Below are some practical instructions that might help you in the process of creating and updating plugins and packages for use in the RHDH Extensions catalog plugin.

## `packages/`

Packages describe the frontend and backend packages that form part of a plugin. The packages folder contains the individual `package.yaml` files where you can set various details about your plugin packages. For an example, see the 3scale package details in `packages/backstage-community-plugin-3scale-backend.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions.backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Package # Important to set the kind
metadata:
  name: backstage-community-plugin-3scale-backend # This name is important - it provides a linkage from the plugin record
  namespace: rhdh # This plugin package is built by us and provided in RHDH
  title: "@backstage-community/plugin-3scale-backend"
  links: # Links to useful sources etc.

## `packages/all.yaml`

You **must** add your package yaml file to the list in the `packages/all.yaml` file to get it picked up by RHDH and loaded into the catalog. To check if it's loading, check the catalog.

## `plugins/`

The files in the `plugins` folder describe the plugins themselves. The plugins folder contains the individual `plugin.yaml` files where you can set various details about your plugin - many of which appear on screen in RHDH in the "Extensions" catalog tab. For an example, see the 3scale package details in `plugins/3scale.yaml`.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins/refs/heads/main/workspaces/marketplace/json-schema/plugins.json
apiVersion: extensions.backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Plugin # Important to set the kind
metadata:
  name: 3scale # The catalog entity name
  namespace: rhdh # This plugin is built by us and provided in RHDH
  title: 3scale
  annotations:
    extensions.backstage.io/pre-installed: 'true' # Not used, but would tell us if the plugin were pre-instralled
    extensions.backstage.io/verified-by: Red Hat # Set the verified status
    # extensions.backstage.io/certified-by: Red Hat # Set the certified status

    Key features include access control, usage analytics, and policy enforcement. 
    The 3scale plugin synchronizes your 3scale content into the software catalog.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the Red Hat Developer Hub documentation in the links below for details of how to install, activate, and configure plugins.

## `plugins/all.yaml`

You **must** add your plugin yaml file to the list in the `plugins/all.yaml` file to get it picked up by RHDH and loaded into the catalog. To check if it's loading, check the catalog.


# Using RHDH-local

You need to reconfigure a few bits for the rhdh-1.5 image build, but when you do your local edits will show up within 15 secs...

In `app-config.yaml` do this:

```yaml:app-config.yaml

catalog:
  # Speed up the metadata refresh interval (when testing)
  processingInterval: { seconds: 15 }

  locations:
    # Extensions Plugin needs this target to pull in the information about Plugins
    - type: file
      target: /marketplace/catalog-entities/plugins/all.yaml
      rules:
        - allow: [Location, Plugin]
    - type: file
      target: /marketplace/catalog-entities/packages/all.yaml
      rules:
        - allow: [Location, Package]

```

In `docker-compose.yaml` do this:

```yaml:docker-compose.yaml
services:
  rhdh:
    volumes:
      # Add an Extensions overwrite
      - type: bind
        source: <your rhdh cloned repo>/catalog-entities/marketplace/plugins/
        target: /marketplace/catalog-entities/plugins
      - type: bind
        source: <your rhdh cloned repo>/catalog-entities/marketplace/packages/
        target: /marketplace/catalog-entities/packages
```

## Troubleshooting

Some issues you may encounter and how to get around them.

### Duplicate Entries

Because Backstage doesn't remove catalog entries when the source changes, sometimes you will end up with duplicates. For example
if you rename a plugin file, you may end up with the old catalog entry sticking around. To fix this you need to purge the
backstage database. If running the in-memory database, this is easily acheived by restarting the container:

```bash
docker compose restart rhdh # or podman-compose restart rhdh
```

### Catalog stops loading or refreshing

Sometimes you might make a mistake with a plugin yaml file. If that happens you can use commenting of lines in the `plugins/all.yaml`
to stop certain plugins from being loaded into the catalog. You can allso search for `all.yaml` in the RHDH logs to see if you can 
find a clue as to what caused the catalog entries to stop loading. For example:

```bash
rhdh  | {"entity":"location:rhdh/plugins","level":"\u001b[33mwarn\u001b[39m","location":"file:/marketplace/catalog-entities/plugins/all.yaml","message":"YAML error at file:/marketplace/catalog-entities/plugins/keycloak-catalog-integration.yaml, YAMLParseError: Map keys must be unique at line 99, column 3:\n\n  #   level: tech-preview\n  lifecycle: production\n  ^\n","plugin":"catalog","service":"backstage","timestamp":"2025-03-11 15:56:57"}
```

### Is my plugin here or missing?

You can trace packages back to plugin entries using the VS Code "Find In Folder..." feature. For example:

1. Given the plugin ID `@backstage-community/plugin-quay` (replace with the plugin ID you need)
1. Do a "Find in Folder..." search for the `package/` file that contains this entry.
1. The `/packages/backstage-community-plugin-quay.yaml` contains this entry. 
1. Open this file and look for the `metadata.name` (`backstage-community-plugin-quay`).
1. Now do a search in the plugins folder for the text `backstage-community-plugin-quay`.
1. The `plugins/backstage-community-plugin-quay.yaml` contains this text.
1. You can open the file and edit the text.

If you do not find a plugin.yaml associated with this plugin ID then it is probably missing and you need to create one. The
file `1boilerplate.yaml` has a good starting point for creating these files.


## Important Notes:

* Plugins are manually created
* Packages are generated with the command below

```bash
# in rhdh root
npx --yes @red-hat-developer-hub/marketplace-cli generate --namespace rhdh -p dynamic-plugins.default.yaml -o catalog-entities/marketplace/packages
```
