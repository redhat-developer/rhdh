    Regex Software Template Action is a plugin that allows you to use regular expressions in software templates, bringing a 
    new level of flexibility to your software development process. "String replace" allows templates to access the replace() method 
    of String values which returns a new string with one, some, or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. 
    
    The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function called for each match. 
    If pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced. The original string is left unchanged.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub) 
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other 
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
