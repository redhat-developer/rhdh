    The Notifications System provides a way for plugins and external services to send notifications to Red Hat Developer Hub users. These notifications are displayed in the dedicated page of the Red Hat Developer Hub frontend UI or by frontend plugins per specific scenarios. Additionally, notifications can be sent to external channels (like email) via "processors" implemented within plugins.

    Notifications can be optionally integrated with the signals (a push mechanism) to ensure users receive them immediately.


    Notifications are messages sent to either individual users or groups. They are not intended for inter-process communication of any kind.

    There are two basic types of notifications:

    - Broadcast: Messages sent to all users of Backstage.
    - Entity: Messages delivered to specific listed entities, such as Users or Groups.

    Example of use-cases:

    - System-wide announcements or alerts
    - Notifications for component owners: e.g., build failures, successful deployments, new vulnerabilities
    - Notifications for individuals: e.g., updates you have subscribed to, new required training courses
    - Notifications pertaining to a particular entity in the catalog: A notification might apply to an entity and the owning team.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
