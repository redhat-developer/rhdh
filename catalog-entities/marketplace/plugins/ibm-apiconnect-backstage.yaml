    The API Connect plug-in consolidates all your API Connect instances into a single location. By using the provider API, the plug-in groups data from each instance and displays it in a centralized dashboard. This grouping of data provides a clear overview of data distribution between different API Connect instances.
     The plug-in is valid for IBMÂ® API Connect version 10.0.8.0 and later.
