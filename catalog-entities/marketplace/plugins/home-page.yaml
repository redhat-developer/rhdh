    Home Page is a plugin that allows you to customize the home page of Red Hat Developer Hub. 
    The home page is the first page that users see when they log in to Red Hat Developer Hub. 
    You can use this plugin to add custom content to the home page, such as links to important resources, 
    announcements, or other information that you want to share with users. 
    
    The home page can be customized using a simple configuration file that allows you to define sections 
    with different types of content, such as text, links, images, and more.

    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
