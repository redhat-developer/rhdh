    The SonarQube Plugin displays code statistics from SonarCloud or SonarQube. SonarQube (formerly Sonar)
    is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality to perform 
    automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs and code smells on 29 programming languages. 
    SonarQube offers reports on duplicated code, coding standards, unit tests, code coverage, code complexity, 
    comments, bugs, and security recommendations.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub) 
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other 
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
