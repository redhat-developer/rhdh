    The RBAC plugin offers a streamlined user interface for effectively managing permissions in your Backstage instance. It allows you to assign 
    permissions to users and groups, empowering them to view, create, modify and delete Roles, provided they have the necessary permissions.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub) 
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other 
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
