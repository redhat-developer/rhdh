  description: |
    The Open Cluster Management (OCM) plugin integrates your Backstage instance with the `MultiClusterHub` and `MultiCluster` engines of OCM.

    The OCM plugin has the following capabilities:

    - All clusters represented as `ManagedCluster` in `MultiClusterHub` or MCE are discovered and imported into the Backstage catalog, such as:
      - Entity is defined as `kind: Resource` with `spec.type` set to `kubernetes-cluster`.
      - Links to the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) console, OCM console, and OpenShift Cluster Manager are provided in `metadata.links`.
    - Shows real-time data from OCM on the Resource entity page, including:
      - Cluster current status (up or down)
      - Cluster nodes status (up or down)
      - Cluster details (console link, OCP, and Kubernetes version)
      - Details about available compute resources on the cluster

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
