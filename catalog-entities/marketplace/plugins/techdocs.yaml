    The Red Hat Developer Hub instance comes with the TechDocs plugin preinstalled and enabled by default.
    Your organization can use the TechDocs plugin to create,
    find, and manage documentation in a central location and in a standardized way. You can also enhance your technical
    documentation experience with built-in TechDocs features and add-ons. For example:

    * Discover your technical documentation directly from the Software Catalog.
    * Create documentation-only sites for any purpose by just writing Markdown.
    * Take advantage of the TechDocs Addon Framework to add features on top of the base docs-like-code experience.
    * Explore and take advantage of the large ecosystem of MkDocs plugins to create a rich reading experience.
    * Integrated with Backstage search - search for and find docs instantly.

     Your organization can use the TechDocs plugin to create, find, and manage documentation in a central location and in a standardized way.
     You can also enhance your technical documentation experience with built-in TechDocs features and add-ons. For example:

    ## Docs-like-code approach

    Write your technical documentation in Markdown files that are stored inside your project repository along with your code.

    ## Documentation site generation

    Use MkDocs to create a full-featured, Markdown-based, static HTML site for your documentation that is rendered centrally in {product-short}.

    ## Documentation site metadata and integrations

    See additional metadata about the documentation site alongside the static documentation, such as the date of the last update, the site owner, top contributors, open GitHub issues, Slack support channels, and Stack Overflow Enterprise tags.

    ## Built-in navigation and search

    Locate the information that you need within a document quickly and easily.

    ## Add-ons

    Customize your TechDocs experience with add-ons to address higher-order documentation needs.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
