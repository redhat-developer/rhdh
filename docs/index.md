# Getting Started running RHDH

There are several different methods for running the RHDH app today. We currently have support for running the application locally, using a helm chart to deploy to a cluster, and manifests for deployment using ArgoCD.

## Telemetry collection

The telemetry data collection feature is used to enhance your experience with the application.

**Telemetry data collection is enabled by default.**

To disable telemetry data collection, you need to disable the [`@backstage-community/plugin-analytics-provider-segment`](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/analytics/plugins/analytics-provider-segment) plugin as documented below.

- **Anonymous configuration**:

  - IP addresses are anonymized (`maskIP: true`), and recorded as `0.0.0.0`.
  - `anonymousId` used for tracking is a hash derived from the user's username.

- **Data Collection Overview**:
  - **Events Tracked**: Page visits, clicks on links or buttons.
  - **Common Data Points for All Events**:
    - User-related info: locale, timezone, userAgent (browser and OS details).
    - Page-related info: title, category, extension name, URL, path, referrer, search parameters.

The collected data is analyzed to understand your interactions with the application and to improve the offerings and your experience.

To enable or disable telemetry data collection and customize a telemetry destination, see the following sections.

### Disable Telemetry

To turn off the telemetry feature, you must disable the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin either using the Helm Chart or the RHDH Operator.

NOTE: If the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin is already present in your dynamic plugins configuration, set the value of the `plugins.disabled` parameter to `true` to disable telemetry, or `false` to enable it.

#### Using Helm Chart

Add the following code in your Helm configuration file:

```yaml
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
      - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment'
        disabled: true
```

#### Using RHDH Operator

When using RHDH Operator, you must modify the `ConfigMap` file created for dynamic plugin configuration. You specify the name of this `ConfigMap` file in the `dynamicPluginsConfigMapName` field of your `Backstage` custom resource. Usually, the `ConfigMap` file is named as `dynamic-plugins-rhdh`.
Add the following code to your `ConfigMap`` file:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dynamic-plugins-rhdh
data:
  dynamic-plugins.yaml: |
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment'
        disabled: true
```

### Disable Telemetry for Local Development

By default, the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin is disabled when you run your application locally without using the `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file.
However, if you run your application using the `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file, you can disable the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin as shown in the following example:

```yaml
dynamicPlugins:
  plugins:
    - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment'
      disabled: true
```

Than delete the `dynamic-plugins-root/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment` plugin directory, to stop plugin from loading.

### Disabling Telemetry in Continuous Integration (CI) Environments

To disable telemetry while running Backstage in a CI environment, set the value of the `SEGMENT_TEST_MODE` environment variable to `true`. This action deactivates telemetry transmissions.

### Enable Telemetry

To turn on the telemetry feature, you must enable the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin either using the Helm Chart or the RHDH Operator.

NOTE: If the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin is already present in your dynamic plugins configuration, set the value of the `plugins.disabled` parameter to `false` to enable telemetry, or `true` to enable it.

#### Using Helm Chart

Add the following code in your Helm configuration file:

```yaml
global:
  dynamic:
    plugins:
      - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment'
        disabled: false
```

#### Using RHDH Operator

If you have created the `dynamic-plugins-rhdh` ConfigMap file, add the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin to the list of plugins and set the `plugins.disabled` parameter to `true` to disable telemetry, or `false` to enable it.

If you have not created the `dynamic-plugins-rhdh` ConfigMap file, create it with the following content:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dynamic-plugins-rhdh
data:
  dynamic-plugins.yaml: |
    includes:
      - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
    plugins:
      - package: './dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment'
        disabled: false
```

Set the value of the `dynamicPluginsConfigMapName` parameter to the name of the `ConfigMap` file in your `Backstage` custom resource:

```yaml
spec:
  application:
    dynamicPluginsConfigMapName: dynamic-plugins-rhdh
```

See these docs for more info:
* https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.4/html-single/configuring_dynamic_plugins/index#installing-ansible-plug-ins-for-red-hat-developer-hub or
* https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.4/html-single/configuring/configuring-the-deployment#configuring-the-deployment


### Customizing Telemetry Destination

By default, the `analytics-provider-segment` plugin is configured to send data to Red Hat. To change the destination that receives telemetry data, set the value of the `SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY` environment variable in your Helm configuration file as shown in the following examples.

#### Example using Helm Chart

```yaml
upstream:
  backstage:
    extraEnvVars:
      - name: SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY
        value: <segment_key>
```

#### Example using RHDH Operator

```yaml
extraEnvs:
  envs:
    - name: SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY
      value: <segment_key>
```

If you wish to subsequently disable telemetry data collection, use one of the following methods described below.

## Running Locally with a basic configuration

The easiest and fastest method for getting started: RHDH app, running it locally only requires a few simple steps.

1. Copy `app-config.example.yaml` and rename it as `app-config.local.yaml`.

2. Ensure you have the following developer tools installed:

   - If you are on a Fedora/Red Hat Linux distribution run: `sudo dnf install python3 make g++ zlib-devel brotli-devel openssl-devel libuv-devel`
   - If you are on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux distribution run: `sudo apt-get install python3 g++ build-essential`
   - If you are on Windows, then follow the [instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows) in `node-gyp` for Windows
   - If you are on macOS, then follow the [instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-macos) in `node-gyp` for macOS

3. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies

4. Start the application using `yarn start`

5. Navigate to <http://localhost:7007>

## Running Locally with the Optional Plugins

1. Create an `app-config.local.yaml` file that will be used for storing the environment variables that the showcase app needs

2. Ensure you have the following developer tools installed:

   - If you are on a Fedora/Red Hat Linux distribution run: `sudo dnf install python3 make g++ zlib-devel brotli-devel openssl-devel libuv-devel`
   - If you are on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux distribution run: `sudo apt-get install python3 g++ build-essential`
   - If you are on Windows, then follow the [instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows) in `node-gyp` for Windows
   - If you are on macOS, then follow the [instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-macos) in `node-gyp` for macOS

3. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies

4. In the `dynamic-plugins-root` folder, verify that you have the dynamic plugins you want to load into
   the backend application. To have all the plugins originally included in the Showcase application,
   run the following command at the root of the showcase repository:

   ```bash
   yarn export-dynamic -- -- --dev
   ```

   **Note:** The `-- --` arguments are required to forward the `--dev` argument to every yarn workspace providing an `export-dynamic` script.

5. Copy the required configuration to the `app-config.local.yaml` file


6. Start the application using `yarn start`, please note that the frontend will be served from the backend as static assets

7. Navigate to <http://localhost:7007>

8.  Alternatively, you can start application using `yarn dev` which would run the frontend using webpack, which allows for hot reloads.

    To use `yarn dev`, change the following in your app-config.local.yaml:

    ```yaml
    app:
      baseUrl: http://localhost:3000

    backend:
      baseUrl: http://localhost:7007
      cors:
        origin: http://localhost:3000
        methods: [GET, HEAD, PATCH, POST, PUT, DELETE]
        credentials: true
    ```

    This will automatically open `http://localhost:3000` in your default browser.

## Optional Configuration and Plugins

- Enabling Authentication in Showcase
     - Refer to the [authentication documentation](./auth.md) for the available auth providers and the steps to configure them.

- Setup the RBAC plugin

     - This [URL](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/rbac/plugins/rbac-backend) explains how to use the RBAC Backend Plugin.

       - Requires the use of an identity provider. This plugin will not work with guest accounts.

     - Set `backend.auth.keys` to a generated base64 secret. This [URL](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/service-to-service-auth/#setup) has more information on setting up a key for service-to-service authentication.

       ```yaml
       backend:
         auth:
           keys:
             - secret: ${BACKEND_SECRET}
       ```

     - Enable and configure policy admins. Replace USERNAME with the username you used to sign into Showcase.

       ```yaml
       permission:
         enabled: true
         rbac:
           admin:
             users:
               - name: user:default/<USERNAME>
       ```

     - Add permission policies via file. Create a rbac policy csv at the root of the showcase repository named `rbac-policy.csv` and fill it with the information below. This example will grant read access to catalog entities for your user.

       ```csv
       p, role:default/team_a, catalog-entity, read, allow

       g, user:default/<USERNAME>, role:default/team_a
       ```

     - Add the `rbac-policy.csv` to the config file.

       ```yaml
       permission:
         enabled: true
         rbac:
           policies-csv-file: ../../rbac-policy.csv
           admin:
             users:
               - name: user:default/<USERNAME>
       ```



### Note: Extension to Kubernetes Backend Plugin

The Kubernetes plugin has a default API factory that work right out the box with a few `oidcProviders` for authentication, but `oidc.oidc` is not included. An additional utility API has been added to the `backstage-plugin-kubernetes` plugin to allow the use of `oidcTokenProvider: 'oidc'` in the plugin configuration.

```yaml
kubernetes:
  clusterLocatorMethods:
    - type: 'config'
      clusters:
        authProvider: 'oidc'
        oidcTokenProvider: 'oidc'
```
